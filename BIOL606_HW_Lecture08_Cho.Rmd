#Step 0: Verify current directory
```{r}
print("The analysis started...")
print(paste("YOUR current working directory is:", getwd()))
```

#Step 1: Invoke necessary packages
```{r setup, message=FALSE}
library(AICcmodavg)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggfortify)
library(corrplot)
library(multcomp)
library(ggplot2)
library(nlme)
library(car)

print("Done. All packages loaded")
```

#Step 2-A (HW Question #1 / Prompt #1): Import data and make exploratory data plots
```{r}
#Read data and save as data frame
limp <- read.csv("Limpet_grazing.csv")

print("Done. Data loaded as saved as dataframe")

dim(limp)
head(limp)
```

#Step 2-B (HW Question #1 / Prompt #1): Import data and make exploratory data plots
```{r}
#Convert "Site" column as a factor
limp$Site <- as.factor(limp$Site)

#Verify if the column has been properly converted to the factor
print(paste("Is the column 'site' factor? (FYI, 'TRUE' if Yes & 'FALSE' if No):" , is.factor(limp$Site)))
```

#Step 2-C (HW Question #1 / Prompt #1): Import data and make exploratory data plots
```{r}
#Make exploratory data plots

#Limpettreat is categorical predictor,x
#tempC is IV,x
#Fo is DV,Y
inital_plot <- ggplot(limp, aes(x = TempC, y = Fo, col = LimpetTreat)) +  
                geom_boxplot() + 
                facet_wrap(.~LimpetTreat)

print(inital_plot)
```

#Step 2-D (HW Question #1 / Prompt #1): Import data and make exploratory data plots
```{r}
#quick look at the variation among blocks
ggblock <- ggplot(limp, aes(x = Site, y = Fo, col=Site)) + geom_boxplot()

print(ggblock)
```

#Step 3 (HW Question #2 / Prompt #2): Fit a linear model with L-Treat & TempC interaction accounting for blocking by Site
```{r}
#make the model using lme()
#the "random = ~1|block" part tells the lme function that the (categorical) variable block is being treated as the random intercept (From the LECTURE blocked example code)
blockmodel <- lme(Fo ~ LimpetTreat * TempC, random = ~1|Site, data = limp, method="ML")

#Do anova
anova(blockmodel)

#Do summary
summary(blockmodel)
```

#Step 4 (Hw Question #3 / Prompt #3): Produce diagnostic plots to check for homoscedasticity and normality of the  residuals
```{r}
#(From the LECTURE 08 blocked example code) his produces the same as the first auto plot 
plot(blockmodel) 

#(From the LECTURE 08 blocked example code)This produces the qqnorm like you see in the auto plot 
qqnorm(residuals(blockmodel))

## Add a theoretical line according to the normal distribution on qqnorm
##Check out more: https://statisticsglobe.com/r-qqplot-qqnorm-qqline-function
qqline(residuals(blockmodel), col = "red")   

#(From the LECTURE 08 blocked example code) A way to just look at a historgram of the residuals to eyeball normality
hist(resid(blockmodel))
```

#Step 5-A (Hw Question #4 / Prompt #4): Write a results statement based on your model output, reporting the relevant  significant terms
```{r}
#(From the LECTURE 08 blocked example code) Another approach to evaluating your fixed factors is to test each factor one at a time, using likelihood ratio tests. This is used fairly commonly, but it still has the challenge of deciding which order to test things 

#(From the LECTURE 08 blocked example code) likelihood ratio approach - manually testing each fixed factor
blockmodel2 <- update(blockmodel, ~.-LimpetTreat:TempC) 

#(From the LECTURE 08 blocked example code) perform the likelihood ratio test, which compares the two models. If they are significantly different, that is evidence that the thing you took out (in this case, the AMF:damage interaction, is important for explaining variation in your DV
anova(blockmodel,blockmodel2) 
```

#Step 5-B (Hw Question #4 / Prompt #4): Write results statement based on your model output, reporting the relevant  significant terms
```{r}
#(From the LECTURE 08 blocked example code) REFIT BLOCKMODEL
options(contrasts = c("contr.sum","contr.poly")) 
blockmodel <- lme(Fo ~ LimpetTreat * TempC, random = ~1|Site, data = limp, method = "ML")

#(From the LECTURE 08 blocked example code) type III ANOVA test
Anova(blockmodel, type=3) 
options(contrasts = c("contr.treatment","contr.poly"))
```

#Step 5-C (Hw Question #4 / Prompt #4): Write a results statement based on your model output, reporting the relevant  significant terms
```{r}
print("There was a siginificant effect of the LimpetTreat X TempC interactionon on the response, Fo, amount of microalgae on plates (likelihood ratio = 17.90724, p=5e-04). The amount of microalgae on plates  is definitely affected by the Limp Treatment , but the amount of microalgae on plates is somewhat affected by temperature")
